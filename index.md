### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite because I like the game Blackjack. It was really fun to take functions and pieces of what we had learned from previous labs to be able to recreate the game in C++.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 is where we made a gif of gradient RGB lights. I like this lab because it gives a visual display of what work I have done and it makes it gave a sense of accomplishment once it worked properly.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 is where we use loop nests to create a game. I liked this lab because nested loops are going to be important going forward, and after working hard to make the program run properly, it was satisfying to be able to win the game that we made.
